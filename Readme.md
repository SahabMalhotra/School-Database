At first I want to thank you for giving the opportunity to explore this much tech.
So this assignment is made up of many things Express, MongoDb, GithubAuth and many additional features.
I try to make this as real world app
This school management system helps student to regsiter in school with their information which is stored in school database and school authorities can manage that information.
Moreover, school management can add new courses.
The additional feature that I added is export data to excel or pdf.

Apart from that, before commiting in main repo I make a draft app everytime so that I can have less errors in main repo which I also did this time.
While making this app I explore many things and errors also what is coding without errors
It was really fun and I thankful for this opportunity.
